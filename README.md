# DIY Pomodoro Timer

Just a basic Pomodoro timer I made for myself. Got tired of all the ads and junk on other sites, so I made my own. Whenever I've got some free time between fixing stuff, I tinker with the code to make it better.

No fancy stuff, just a tool to help me focus and get things done. Here's to fixing procrastination one Pomodoro at a time!
